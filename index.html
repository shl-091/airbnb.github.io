      <h1 class="hero-title">Wanna Travel to London? You Must See This!</h1>
      <h2 class="hero-author">By Shentong Li</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        The project aim to visualize the data to gain insights into the Airbnb market in London. 
        By comparing prices and ratings across different regions in London, I can identify 
        variations in pricing and quality of accommodations, allowing users to make informed 
        decisions. Exploring overall guest satisfaction ratings can reveal the living place 
        with the highest and lowest satisfaction levels, providing valuable information for 
        potential guests.

      <h1 class="section-title">Average Satisfaction Score Distribution</h1>
      <p class="section-text">
        In my own experience, a good Airbnb experience consists of many things: 
        smooth and comfortable communication with the host; the room should be 
        neat and tidy; privacy can be guaranteed. A good stay can make the whole 
        trip more enjoyable. So I selected the top accommodation areas in London 
        (the red regions, which are usually close to the city centre) and plotted 
        their average ratings on the London map. The darker red indicates a higher score, 
        whereas the lighter red indicates a lower score.

      <p class="section-text">
        In addition to satisfaction, I will also care about the price of the
        accommodation. When I'm planning my trip, I only focus on houses that 
        are within my budget. So here is the scatter plot of price and satisfaction 
        score.

      <h1 class="section-title">Advantages of Different Accommodation Areas</h1>
      <p class="section-text">
        London is a big and bustling city, living in different places will have 
        different advantages and disadvantages. For example, living in the city 
        center can enjoy convenient transportation, but at the same time may not 
        be too safe. If you live far from the city, you may live in a larger place 
        and have better privacy, but you may need to take a taxi to visit the 
        attractions, so there will be an extra commuting cost. The following network 
        shows the pros and cons of different accommodation areas. Additionally, the 
        thickness of the lines represents the average price of that region. The thicker
        the line, the higher the price.
        <br></br>
        <p class="good-points">Benefits:</p>
        Super-host: The host received widespread praise
        <br></br>
        Clean: The house is neat and clean
        <br></br>
        Close-to-Metro: convenient transportation
        <br></br>
        Whole-place: Instead of living with a landlord, you have temporary use 
        of the entire house
        <br></br>
        <p class="bad-points">Disadvantages:</p>
        Unsafe: The area is not safe and there is a common crime (such as robbery)
